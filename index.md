This tutorial is aimed at the novice bioinformatician and is  intended to demonstrate how to download publicly 
available ChIP-sea and ATAC-seq SRA files from the GEO repository and process it to produce *bam files* and 
*bed files* for downstream analyses.

Whilst there are more efficent tools available to automate the processes described here, I think it is important 
to run each step individually when starting out to get a better handle what is going on and to understand how 
and why we modify the various file formats at each stage.

This tutorial uses **LINUX**.
