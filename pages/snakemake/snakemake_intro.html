# Using snakemake for workflow management

### What is snakemake?

Snakemake is a workflow management and job scheduling tool which allows you to produce reproducible and 
scaleable bioinformatics workflows efficently. Workflow management tools allow you to automate multi-step
bioinformatics analyses (e.g. data collection, QC, processing and visualisation) and make it easier to 
organise complex pipelines in a human readable manner. 

Reasons for using Snakemake:

- Automation: Allows you to automate mundane steps of bioinformatics process to focus more on data analysis
- Reproducibility: Promotes scientifc reproducibility 
- Error tracking: Reduces the effort required to correct errors as they are easier to track (reduces the need for complex boilerplate bash code)
- Portability: Rule based system for subprocess organisation makes it easy to reuse / adapt workflow to new datasets across systems
- Readability: Snakemake uses python
- File creation is tracked: 
    - By completion: If a process crashes unexpectedly snakemake will automatically delete any corrupted / incomplete files
    - By date: so if you change a file at stage 2 of the process snakemake will infom you to rerun all subsequent processes
- Makes parellisation easy
- Allows you to easily assign specific resources to each subprocess
