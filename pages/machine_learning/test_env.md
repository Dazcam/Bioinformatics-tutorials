## GDP and happiness
We will start building a very simple model to predict people Happiness (as measured 
by the [OECD](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=BLI)) based on the 
country's GDP (as provided by the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/world-economic-outlook-databases)).
This is also called model-based learning. For this course we will use Scikit-Learn
but other libraries should provide similar functionalities. 

> ## Obtaining and working with data
> When developing Machine Learning applications you will likely need to work with
> databases either by creating them yourself or obtaining some already available. 
> Depending on the field and stage of your research, the databases can range from a
> few megabytes to several hundreds gigabytes and ever bigger. At that point you'll
> likely need to consider carefully (even more if the database has data protection
> requirements) how best to manage storage requirements in order to optimize 
> available resources in your work system. Do not hesitate to contact your system
> administrators to discuss further any doubts or concerns that you might have.
>
> Luckily for this training the databases we will be working with are publicly
> available from the [OECD's Better Life Index](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=BLI))
> and the [IMF's GDP per capita](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/world-economic-outlook-databases))
> and only occupy a few megabytes. You can also find them in the zip file provided 
> for this training course.

Start by loading some python libraries.
~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn.linear_model
~~~
{: .language-python}

Continue by loading the data as Pandas dataframes. For this you need to provide the
corresponding file locations, for example:
~~~
root_path="ARC-An-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/gdp-bli/"
oecd_life_sat = pd.read_csv(root_path+"BLI_25112020150937807.csv", thousands=',')
imf_gdp_per_capita = pd.read_csv(root_path+"gdp_per_capita_2014-2025.csv",thousands=',',delimiter='\t',encoding='latin1', na_values="n/a")
~~~
{: .language-python}

You can take a look at the data we just loaded with the *head* dataframe function,
for example, to print the first 5 rows in the GDP dataframe:
~~~
rows=5
imf_gdp_per_capita.head(rows)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Next we define a helper function to filter and restructure OECD's data in a more
suitable way; rename the column corresponding to 2020 in IMF's GDP per capita data
and set the country name as index; we then merge the dataframes using their indexes
(country name) and sort the resulting dataframe by GDP value (in ascending order).
To emulate the creation of a test dataset we save only a subset of our newly created
dataframe. Some of the removed datapoints correspond to South Africa, Colombia,
Iceland and Denmark. We can later use the data corresponding to these countries to 
validate our Machine Learning Model.
~~~
def prepare_country_stats(oecd_bli, imf_gdp):
    oecd_bli = oecd_bli[oecd_bli["INEQUALITY"]=="TOT"]
    oecd_bli = oecd_bli.pivot(index="Country", columns="Indicator",
                              values="Value")
    imf_gdp.rename(columns={"2020": "GDP per capita (2020)"},
                   inplace=True)
    imf_gdp.set_index("Country", inplace=True)
    full_data = pd.merge(left=oecd_bli, right=imf_gdp,
                         left_index=True, right_index=True)
    full_data.sort_values(by="GDP per capita (2020)",
                          inplace=True)
    remove_indices = [0, 1, 6, 8, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]
    keep_indices = list(set(range(full_data.shape[0])) - set(remove_indices))
    test_data = full_data[["GDP per capita (2020)",
                           'Life satisfaction']].iloc[keep_indices]
    validate_data = full_data[["GDP per capita (2020)",
                           'Life satisfaction']].iloc[remove_indices]
    return test_data, validate_data
~~~
{: .language-python}

Use the previously defined helper function and extract the data for "GDP per capita
(2020)" and "Life satisfaction" as column vectors using Numpy.
~~~
country_stats_test, country_stats_validate = prepare_country_stats(oecd_life_sat, imf_gdp_per_capita)
X = np.c_[country_stats_test["GDP per capita (2020)"]]
y = np.c_[country_stats_test["Life satisfaction"]]
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Building the model
At this point it might be useful to visualize our data in order to gain some insight
about the type of model that might be more useful to describe it:
~~~
country_stats_test.plot(kind='scatter', x="GDP per capita (2020)", y='Life satisfaction',xlim=[0,60000],ylim=[0,10])
plt.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/life-satisfaction-vs-gdp.png" 
     alt="GDP vs Life Satisfaction" 
     width="50%" 
     height="50%" />

There does seem to be a trend here! Although the data is noisy (i.e., partly random),
it looks like life satisfaction goes up more or less linearly as the country’s GDP
per capita increases. So you decide to model life satisfaction as a linear function
of GDP per capita. This step is called *model selection*: you selected a 
[*linear model*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html) of life 
satisfaction with just one attribute, GDP per capita:
~~~
model = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()
~~~
{: .language-python}

With the model selected, the next step is to fit it to the data. The calculations
performed in this step are model dependent, for example, for a linear model it 
involves calculating a set of coefficients to minimize the residual sum of squares 
between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear 
approximation.
~~~
model.fit(X, y)
~~~
{: .language-python}

And we can access the estimated value for the model key parameters (which parameters 
are available also depends on the selected model).
~~~
print(f"model's intercept: {model.intercept_[0]}")
print(f"model's slope    : {model.coef_[0][0]}")
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
model's intercept: 5.375355125502892
model's slope    : 3.563396686332422e-05
~~~
{: .output}

It might be useful to plot our model along side our data:
~~~
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax1.scatter(country_stats_test["GDP per capita (2020)"],country_stats_test["Life satisfaction"])
ax1.set_xlim(0,60000)
ax1.set_ylim(0,10)
ax1.set_xlabel("GDP per capita (2020)")
ax1.set_ylabel("Life satisfaction")
x_val=np.array([list(range(0,60000,1000))]).T
ax1.plot(x_val, model.predict(x_val),color='r')
plt.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/life-satisfaction-vs-gdp-regression-line.png" alt="GDP vs Life Satisfaction - Regression Line" width="50%" height="50%" />

## Validating and making predictions
After we have trained our model we should perform some validation checks using the 
labelled data we saved for this purpose:
~~~
print("Country               GDP  BLI(pred) BLI")
for country, row in country_stats_validate.iterrows():
    gdp_real = row[0]
    bli_real = row[1]
    gdp_pred = model.predict([[gdp_real]])
    print("{0:14}  {1:9.2f}  {2:5.2f}  {3:7.2f}".format(country, gdp_real, gdp_pred[0][0], bli_real))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Country               GDP  BLI(pred) BLI
South Africa      4735.75   5.54     4.70
Colombia          5207.24   5.56     6.30
Chile            12612.32   5.82     6.50
Hungary          15372.89   5.92     5.60
Iceland          57189.03   7.41     7.50
Denmark          58438.85   7.46     7.60
United States    63051.40   7.62     6.90
Norway           67988.59   7.80     7.60
Ireland          79668.50   8.21     7.00
Switzerland      81867.46   8.29     7.50
Luxembourg      109602.32   9.28     6.90
~~~
{: .output}

Always helpful to have some visual aids to compare how well our model does compared
with the validation data
~~~
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax1.scatter(country_stats_test["GDP per capita (2020)"],country_stats_test["Life satisfaction"])
ax1.set_xlim(0,110000)
ax1.set_ylim(0,10)
ax1.set_xlabel("GDP per capita (2020)")
ax1.set_ylabel("Life satisfaction")
x_val=np.array([list(range(0,60000,1000))]).T
ax1.plot(x_val, model.predict(x_val),color='r')
ax1.scatter(country_stats_validate["GDP per capita (2020)"],country_stats_validate["Life satisfaction"],color='g')
plt.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/life-satisfaction-vs-gdp-regression-line-validate.png" alt="GDP vs Life Satisfaction - Regression Line" width="50%" height="50%" />

Seems like our model is reasonably good at predicting values that fall within the
range of our training data set but tends to overestimate the observed life
satisfaction of richer countries. This give us an idea of the degree of confidence
that we should have in our very simple model, perhaps we should try modifying the 
model parameters or adding other variables like employment rate, health, air 
pollution and employ slighly more complex models.
