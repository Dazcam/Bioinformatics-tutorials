Computer Science is about problem solving and creativity, about bring something new to life. 
That is not to say that it is not without frustrations. What ultimately matters in this course
is not where you end up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to where you 
began.

How does a compute count? If a human was counting, we could use our fingers to represent people 
in a room. A computer uses a binary system, zeros and ones to represent numbers. One would be 001,
and two would be 010. A bit, i.e. a 1 or a zero, is the most basic unit of information
in computing. Humans operate in the decimal system, 0-9, the prefix 'dec', meaning ten. A 
BYTE is 8 bits. The binary system is used as using a switch / transistor based system, 
1 = on and 0 = off, is a very efficient way to store information for electronic systems. 

Binary and decmimal systems are related in a columnar fashion. Considering the fiest thre columns
the decimal system columns are annotated as 10^2; 10^1; 10^0 whereas the binary system is 
annotated as 2^2; 2^1; 2^0. The higher the number the more bit that are required to encode the 
number in binary. 

But how is non-numerical code stored? A gold standard was agreed to represent, for example, letters.
Capital A is represented as 65 or 01000001. But how does the computer know when 01000001 is supposed 
to represent A or 65? How a paticular binary pattern is represented to us in a GUI is dependent on 
how the program has been written to represent that binary pattern. Excel may represent it as a 
number, whereas Word may represent it as a letter. It is context dependent. This system behind this
is ASCII the American Standarised Code for Information Interchange. However, as ASCII was designed
for American English it had to be updated to represent all the characters in different laguages 
around the world and things like emojis.

Unicode is a supraset of ASCII which maps many more characters using up to 16, or 32 bits rather than 
8 which means there is space to represent up to 4 billion characters. 

Colours are represented as a mix of R,G,B which are also represented as numbers. For video, 
the computer needs to be able to represent time. So a series of images, that are encoded in a 
binary format, are played one after the other. For audio, MIDI stores notes as a sequence of
numbers. But to capture music fully we need to represent, the notes themselves, the duration,
timbre and the volume, so in order to capture analogue human realities qualitatively, these 
apsects of music have to be represented digitally to the computer.
