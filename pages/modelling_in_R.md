# Modelling in R using the Tody modelling workflow

1.1 Why use / what are models?

- Mathmatical tools to capture relationships in data
- Reduce complex relationships into simpler, human readable, terms
- Ease of use and sound scientific methodlogy should underlie all software used for modelling

1.2 Types of models

- **Descriptive** 
    - Describe or illustrate characteristics of some data - e.g. a LOESS regression model to detect trend in house prices
- **Inferential**
    - Used to test scientific hypotheses and produces statistical conclusions - e.g. clincal trial comapring drug efficacies
    - Produce some type of probabilistic output, such as a p-value, confidence interval, or posterior probability
    - Quaility depends on formal probablitic assumptions made about the data
- **Predictive** - designed to produce as accurate a prediction as possible about something - e.g. how many copies of book X will I sell?
    - **Mechanistic model** - build model equation from first principles depending on assumptions
        - Data used to estimate unknown params of equation so predictions can be generated
    - **Empirically driven** - created with more vague assumtions - fall into ML catagory
        - e.g. KNN model - Given ref data a new sample is predicted based on values of K most similar data
        - No theoretical or probabilistic assumptions made about data
        - Evaulation of appropriateness of model is assessed through accuracy using existing data

1.3 CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TYPES OF MODELS

- An ordinary linear regression model might fall into any of these three classes of model, depending on how it is used
- If a model has limited fidelity to the data, the inferences generated by the model should be highly suspect. In other words, statistical significance may not be sufficient proof that a model is appropriate

1.4 Terminology

- **Unsupervised model**
    - Don't have an outcome varaible
    - Learn patterns, clusters, characteristics e.g. PCA
    - Used to understand relationships between variables or sets of variables without an explicit relationship 
    between predictors and an outcome
 - **Supervised model**
    - Have outcome varaible
    - Linear regression / Neural networks etc.
    - Two broad sub-catagories (not exhaustive):
        - Regression predicts a numeric outcome
        - Classification predicts an outcome that is an ordered or unordered set of qualitative values
- **Outcomes**
    - Value being predicted in supervised models (aka labels / endpoints / dependent variables)
- **Independent variables**
    - Used to make predictions of the outcome (aks predictors, features, or covariates)

1.5 HOW DOES MODELING FIT INTO THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS?

Things to think about in advance of analyses:

- Clean your data
- Understand data (aka exploratory data analysis [EDA])
- Set good perfomnce metric (classification accuracy, true and false positive rates, root mean squared error etc.)

Modelling is an iterative process:

- **EDA** - to and fro between numerical analyses and data visualiation / discoveries lead to questions / understanding increases
- **Feature engineering** - Understanding gained from EDA results in more accurate model prediction
- **Model tuning and selection** - Variety of models generated and compared - paramteres are tweaked / tuned
- **Model evaluation** - assess the modelâ€™s performance metrics, examine residual plots, and conduct other EDA-like analyses to understand how well the models work
